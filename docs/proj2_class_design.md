# ENTRY #1

- Decisions made 10/23/2025 : Decided to model the core classes of the project off of the different categories of functions as organized in the function library of the project. This entails that, **unless otherwise noted** in a future reconsideration, that there will be a **total of six core classes** in the project.

# ENTRY #2

- Decisions made 11/20/2025 : The same principle for constructing the classes is being used. However, there will now be a total of **five core classes** designed for project 2 specifically, with the reduction coming from the decision made to merge the storage functions and utilities functions into one class together.

# ENTRY #3

- Note added 12/06/2025 : **For the grader reading this**, please note that the five core classes made for Project 2 (proj2_data_xxxxx_cls.py) **integrated the functions from the Project 1 Function Library by adding methods to the classes themselves that were direct adaptations of the functions from the Project 1 Function Library**, slightly altered to work syntactically with the classes and used by their objects. For example, instance methods of the data analysis class (data_analysis_cls.py) are primarily adapations of the functions that are in the data analysis section of the Project 1 Function Library. We found this more convenient to integrate the 2 projects than using tons of direct imports.
