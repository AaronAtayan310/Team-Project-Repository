ENTRY #1

- Decisions made 10/23/2025 : Decided to model the core classes of the project off of the different categories of functions as organized in the function library of the project. This entails that, unless otherwise noted in a future reconsideration, that there will be a total of six core classes in the project.

ENTRY #2

- Decisions made 11/20/2025 : The same principle for constructing the classes is being used. However, there will now be a total of five core classes designed for project 2 specifically, with the reduction coming from the decision made to merge the storage functions and utilities functions into one class together.
