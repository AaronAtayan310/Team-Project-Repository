# Domain Focus and Problem Statement

Domain: Criminal justice and pattern analytics
Problem Statement: 
    Law enforcement agencies face problems regarding the processing and analyzing of crime data due to 
    data fragmentation, manual processing, and scalability issues.

# Installation and Setup Instructions

This library provides helper functions for **ingesting, cleaning, and analyzing crime rate data**. It is written in Python and relies on common data analysis libraries such as **pandas**.

1. Clone or Download the Repository

If using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-data-library.git
cd crime-data-library
```
Or manually download the `.py` file and place it in your project directory.

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file containing:
```
pandas>=2.0.0
```
Then install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Import the Library in Your Script or Notebook

Once installed, you can import your function library as follows:

import os
import json
import logging
import pickle
import requests
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Iterator, Optional
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
